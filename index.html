                                </h3>

                                   You are one of the coolest people I have ever met. So lucky to have known you since the beginning of my life. You are a multi-talented and hard working person. You deserve all the good things and happiness. I had the most entertaining childhood growing up with the Oza family. From playing running games to playing farmville, and rocking guitar, piano and singing to scoring amazing grades in school, also being an influencer on Zomato followed by featuring in an episode of master chef and also getting featured in articles and newspapers multiple times, working in a vacation spot like Aamby valley and now moving to Canada. I hope all your efforts are always fruitful! This card is not enough to list out the amazing things you have done and achieved in such a short time. Lots more to achieve and inspire all of us here. Keep posting your music sessions, because we all love it. I wish you all the success for the future and I know you will rock in that new position. Thank you and farewell!
